Geojson polygons for unofficial/community-defined neighborhoods in the City of St. Louis and surrounding areas.

The City of St. Louis has 79 different neighborhoods, which are mapped and listed at https://stlouis-mo.gov/neighborhoods/

That said, there are also many other geographic areas that residents and community groups refer to using a neighborhood name.  These "unofficial" neighborhoods are sometimes within or sometimes overlap formal neighborhood boundaries.  They may be well-defined and may have active neighborhood associations.  They may represent historic neighborhood boundaries that some residents still identify with.  Or they may be neighborhoods outside the City of St. Louis within municipalities that have not formally identified and mapped neighborhood boundaries.

This is a place to begin collecting names & boundaries of these unofficial neighborhoods.
